# Font size compare tool
Ever needed to compare the x-hight of fonts as a web developer?

**May god be with you!** and this piece of code...

Usage:
* Manually change the fonts if you need
* Drag the red and blue lines to see and calculate the difference
* Use the notes to jot down the numbers before you go back to edit your font in FontForge or the font-size in css if you are sane

### *Note to future me and to other poor beings that have come to this:*
`Adobe Acrobat` and `Firefox pdf viewer` DOES NOT SCALE / ZOOM WELL. DIFFERENT ZOOM LEVELS WILL BREAK RANDOM LETTERS.

### Also...
[LiberationSans-sized.woff2](https://github.com/ronhasson/font-size-compare-tool/blob/master/LiberationSans-sized.woff2) is the LiberationSans font sized to the same hight as Arial (at least in Hebrew)
